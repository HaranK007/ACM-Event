                Programming… Competitive Programming… It teaches you how to think?. If you are a programmer, you might have understood the deep meaning of these lines quoted by Steve Jobs and you might have also experienced that even after shutting down your computer you keep on thinking about programming stuff or code you have written in your project. Once you enter in programming you just don’t learn how to code but you also learn the “art of thinking”, by breaking your code into smaller chunks and then using your logic-based creativity to solve a problem from different angles. Programming is fun, programming is an exercise for your brain, programming is a mental sport and when this sport is held on the internet involving sports programmer as a contestant, then it is called Competitive Programming. Check what Wikipedia says about Competitive Programming. 
                
                <br>Input:  Crossing Times = {10, 20, 30}
                Output: 60
                Explanation
                1. Firstly person '1' and '2' cross the bridge
                   with total time about 20 min(maximum of 10, 20) 
                2. Now the person '1' will come back with total 
                   time of '10' minutes.
                3. Lastly the person '1' and '3' cross the bridge
                   with total time about 30 minutes
                Hence total time incurred in whole journey will be
                20 + 10 + 30 = 60
                
                Input: Crossing Times = [1, 2, 5, 8]
                Output: 15
